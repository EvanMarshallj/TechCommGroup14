Assignment 3
Do we need to have some indicator that tells that the year entered was correct?

I had some times so fix couple of things of our read me file base on what the prof says. please double check if there is somthing wrong.

The md file looks great.

One question I have is being realistic if we want to get next Game info then we should have date as a parameter rather than year because how will the api get info with just a year as there are many games played in a year. - Anshu
